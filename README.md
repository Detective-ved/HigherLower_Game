# HigherLower_Game

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The Higher Lower Game is a fun and interactive command-line game where players guess whether the next randomly drawn number will have a higher or lower follower count than the current player. Test your intuition and knowledge of popular personalities while aiming for the highest score!

FEATURES:
üé≤ Random selection of players from a curated dataset
‚ùì Players guess whether the next player has a higher or lower follower count
üìà Score tracking based on correct guesses
üèÜ Limited lives to increase the challenge
üåü Option to play multiple rounds

HOW TO PLAY:
Start the game and view the first player‚Äôs details.
You will be prompted to guess if the next player has a higher or lower follower count.
Input your guess (either 'A' for player A or 'B' for player B) and press Enter.
The game reveals the next player's follower count:
If your guess is correct, your score increases, and you continue playing.
If your guess is incorrect, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
You can choose to play again or exit the game.

The game consists of the following key components:

Player Selection: Randomly selects players from the dataset.
Gameplay Logic: Handles player guesses and updates scores based on follower counts.
User Interface: Displays player information and prompts user input in the command line.
Game Flow: Manages turns and lives, providing options to play again or end the game.
